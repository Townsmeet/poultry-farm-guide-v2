 I am going to show you some potent plants or herbs you can use to treat wounds in chickens. Moreover, most medications or plants using in wound healing in humans are also effective in healing chickens’ wounds
It is worthy to note that having the right medication supplies in your chicken first aid kit is as important as having a sick bay or a separate place for your injured or sick chicken.
This will encourage speedy recovery and healing. Leaving your wounded chicken in the flock will not only worsen the situation but will also trigger cannibalism which is a bad vice among chickens-recall, chickens are attracted to the red color of blood and as such will want to peck out of curiosity

## **Sick Bay for Chicken**
### **When do you think it is necessary to set up a sickbay?**
A sickbay should always be part of your plan for any batch of production because nobody knows when an accident will occur. Thus, you should always be on guard against any farm accident. If you don't make provision for a sickbay, you might be forced to treat your injured chicken among the flock which could be disastrous to the chicken and to the rest of the flock. Therefore by having a sickbay, you can easily transfer your wounded chicken to the sickbay for proper treatment and care.

### **What should be in a chicken sickbay?**
An average sickbay should have enough space for the chicken to move around, is accessible for cleaning, and a spacious enough for food and water apart from where it can relieve itself. It will be more comfortable if the place is dimly lit, quiet, and a little warmer than the place the chicken was accustomed to outside. There are so many options for a sickbay. I prefer using a carton to set up something like a  mini [brooder](/blog/ultimate-guide-for-brooding-broiler-in-nigeria/) with lamplight or a rabbit cage.

## **Caring for sick chickens**
Any time you have a sick or injured chicken, the chicken must be kept separately from the flock until the injury is completely healed to avoid further injury, possible spread of a contagious illness, cannibalism, and death. The recuperating area should be a safe, quiet living space where they will remain until they are fully healed.

## **Returning injured chicken to the flock**
1\. The injured chicken should be 100 percent healed with no visible sign of blood or scabbing before you return it to the flock. ( Do not cover it up with a purple dye product is not an acceptable substitute for time and complete healing)
2\. Reintroduce the injured chicken like a stranger to the flock. What I do is that I place the resurgent chicken in a separate pen where they can see one another but not allowed to interact, in that way they will gradually familiarize themselves with the resurgent chicken without any fight or bloodshed.
