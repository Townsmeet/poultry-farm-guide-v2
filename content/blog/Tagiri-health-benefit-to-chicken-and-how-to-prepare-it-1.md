**The use of an organic alternative to synthetic drugs especially antibiotics in poultry farming has shown to be effective for the past few years. Tagiri is one of those organic medicinal plants that is widely used in Nigeria to cure and prevent viral diseases in poultry.**

###### **Tagiri fruits**
As a child of the 90s, who grew up in the southern part of Nigeria, we were used to kicking and playing anything that looks like football while on errands. One of that improvised football was tagiri,  *Adenopus breviflorus* ( Christmas melon). We grew up to know it as ‘snake fruit’ even though we have not seen one feeding on it.

However, little did we know that we were playing with a medicinal plant  Know Tagiri (Christmas melon), which has a health benefit for both man and livestock, especially poultry, although without any scientific support.
But this does not weaken the fact of its medicinal potency. This can be attested by the wide range of people who embraces its use in organic poultry farming for preventing and curing various viral poultry diseases such as Newcastle Disease, Marek’s Disease, and Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD)
In Fact, the result obtained from its [demographical information among poultry farmers](https://ijoardjournal.org/index.php/ijoardjournal/article/view/164) (mainly women who own backyard farms) in various communities in Kwara  and Ekiti states in Nigeria considered 'wild melon' (as it was referred to...) as herbal remedies for some diseases of man and livestock especially poultry (Ogunleye and Atteh, 2019)
Nevertheless, it is important to know how this wonderful melon can be used effectively without any complications. As with synthetic drugs, caution must be taken in the use of organic fighting agents like Tagiri, as this is the only way to maximize the benefits of organic poultry farming without regrets. But do not worry; everything will be highlighted in this post.
## **What is Tagiri Used for?**
One of the uses of Tagiri (Christmas Melon) is a remedy for viral diseases in poultry. For instance, diseases like Newcastle Diseases, Marek's  Diseases, and Infectious Bursal Disease (IBD) can be combated and prevented completely.

## **How to Preserve Tagiri with Molasses**
Add 2-part molasses to 3 part Tagiri extract. That is 1-3. If you have 3 liters of Tagiri extract, you will need to add 1 liter of molasses to preserve it. Note that you do not need to refrigerate it after adding molasses to the extract
### **Tagiri Preservation ( Refrigerator Vs Molasses**)
While you can skip the use of molasses and preserve your Tagiri Extract by refrigeration, it is important to mention that molasses keep the Tagiri extract longer than refrigeration. While it is advisable to use up refrigerated tagiri extract within 1 month, molasses-preserved extract can stay up to 4 months.
The choice of preservation method also depends on the quantity of Tagiri extract you have produced and how long it will take to use it up. In any case, the fresher the Tagiri extract is, the better. So, make sure to produce the quantity you will be able to use up before the extract expires.
## **Dosage of Tagiri Extract**
-    **For Prevention:** Add 10ml of the Tagiri extract to one liter of water weekly
-    **For Treatment:** Add 30ml of the tagiri extract to one liter of water; serve your chickens daily for 5 days consecutively.
