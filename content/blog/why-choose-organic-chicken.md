When you hear the phrase ' Organic Chicken' What actually comes to your mind?

## **What Exactly is organic chicken?**
Organic chicken refers to chickens that are raised according to strict organic standards, which include requirements for feed, living conditions, and medical treatment.
Specifically, organic chickens are raised without the use of antibiotics, hormones, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs).
They are fed certified organic feed free from synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and other harmful chemicals.
Organic chickens also have access to outdoor areas, allowing them to engage in natural behaviors such as scratching and
pecking. In addition, organic farmers must provide their chickens with ample space to move around and prevent overcrowding.
According to the USDA, organic chicken must be raised according to strict standards, which include "access to the outdoors,
natural light, and space to move around, and they must be fed 100% organic feed.
" These standards are designed to promote animal welfare, reduce environmental pollution, and support the health of
consumers who choose organic products.
Studies have shown that organic chicken may offer some health benefits over conventionally raised chicken.

> *Organic chicken meat*
For example, a study published in the Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry found that organic chicken had higher levels of
beneficial omega-3 fatty acids and lower levels of potentially harmful omega-6 fatty acids compared to conventionally raised chicken.
Overall, organic chicken farming prioritizes animal welfare, sustainability, and health, resulting in a high-quality, ethical, and
delicious poultry option for consumers.
One of my doubts about organic chicken farming is; whether is it actually feasible to raise organic chicken according to standards,
especially in undeveloped countries.
Personally, as a poultry farmer, I think it (completely organic) is only possible within developed countries where strict biosecurity
and monitoring is observed, unlike in third-world countries.
Before we look at the limitations of organic chicken, let's take a look at some of the benefits of organic chickens
