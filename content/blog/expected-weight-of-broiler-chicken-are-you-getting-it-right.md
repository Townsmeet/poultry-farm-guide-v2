title: "Expected weight of broiler chicken: Are you getting it right?"
description: "The expected weight of broiler chicken depends on the age of the broiler, sex, and other factors that have to be kept in order to attain the expected weight. However, a well-reared broiler should weigh between 1.2kg to 1.5kg at 4 weeks, this weight increases steadily as the bird ages."

**The expected weight of broiler chicken depends on the age of the broiler, sex, and other [factors that have to be kept in order to attain the expected weight.](/blog/6-smart-tips-to-increase-the-body-weight-of-your-broiler-chicken/) However, a well-reared broiler should weigh between 1.2kg to 1.5kg at 4 weeks, this weight increases steadily as the bird ages.**

###### **A broiler on scale**
Every quest has a mission and an expectation, without an expectation, morale will go down and resources will dry out. So, it is almost important as a poultry farmer to have an expected weight of your broiler chickens as they age, this will not only raise your morale and enthusiasm but will as well lead to better welfare for your broiler chickens to attain the much desire weight- You will be focused with a target and with a better management

So, by the end of this post, you should be able to determine
-   Average daily gain (ADG)
-   Feed Conversion Ratio ( FCR)
-   weight of broiler chicken per day
-   Weight of broiler at 4 weeks
-   Weight of broiler at 6 weeks
-   Weight of broiler chicken per week
-   How many kgs of feed will a broiler consume in 8 weeks
To achieve the above objectives, I am going to provide you with a broiler chart (for male and female broiler) to enable you to determine the expected weight of your broiler chicken at various stages     ![](https://farm-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/img_20201024_214553.jpg)
The following question can be answered using the above chart.
###  **How to calculate Average Daily Gain (ADG)**
Average daily gain is simply the rate of weight gain per day over a specified period of time. For example from the chart, if a chicken weighs 40g on hatch day and later weigh 170g on the 7th day (a week), then it gained (170-40 =130) 130g in 7 days.
Therefore, ADG = weight gain/ number of days = 130/7 =18.57g
  The average daily gain (**ADG**) for the first week is **18.57g**
You can follow the same steps and solve ADG for the rest of the weeks. (Week 2 to 9)
**Note: The body weight on the chart can vary slightly based on the welfare, sex, and age of the bird, which in turn will affect the value of ADG and FCR. I have seen a DOC that weighs 42g at hatch and a 4 weeks broiler of 2.0kg.**
 Next, is to determine the **Feed Conversion Ratio** (FCR)

Don't neglect No 7](https://poultryfarmguide.com/blog/8-things-i-wish-id-know-about-poultry-farming-Don't%20ever-neglect-no-7/)
### **How is FCR calculated in poultry?**
   The feed conversion ratio (FCR) is defined as the amount of feed needed to increase the animal’s body weight by one kilogram.
  The FCR can be calculated by taking the total amount of feed consumed by the chicken and dividing it by the amount of weight gained or the number of eggs produced.
That is **input** divided by **output.** For your broiler production, an FCR of 1.5 means that your broiler chickens gain 1 kilogram of weight for every 1.5 kilograms of feed consumed.
**The lower the FCR, the more efficient your broiler chickens are at converting feed into meat**.
Therefore to calculate FCR for the first week we use
FCR= Cumulative feed intake/weight gain = 150/130 = 1.15
That is 1.15-kilogram feed is needed to gain 1 kilogram of weight.

###  **What is the weight of broiler chicken per day?**
  In general, broiler weight 40 g at hatch
 From the chart, at week 1, an average daily weight gain is 18.57g
Therefore, the weight of a broiler chicken per day for the first week is (40g + 18.57 = 58.57g)   **58.57g**
### **What is the weight of the broiler at 4 weeks?**
 From the chart above, a male and female broiler chicken should attain the average weight of **1.410kg (1410g)** and **1.250kg (1250g)** respectively
### **What is the weight of the broiler at 6 weeks?**
From the chart above, a male and female broiler chicken should attain the average weight of **2.700kg (2700g)** and **2.300kg (2300g)** respectively
### **How many kgs of feed will a broiler consume in 8 weeks?**
A male broiler chicken will consume about 7.4kg and weigh 3.9kg, and
A female broiler chicken will consume about 6.8kg and weigh 3.3kg at 8 weeks
### **Do broilers need light at night?**
Broiler needs light at night for optimal growth and weight gain. They should be fed al-libidum-that is you should feed them both day and night with plenty of water, especially for the first few weeks.

### **What helps broiler gain weight fast?**
A broiler chicken will grow and gain weight fast when it has good welfare and its genetic potential is a harness, like taking advantage of the first 7-day of a chick’s life, sort and spacing the birds, using [natural growth promoters,](https://poultryfarmguide.com/blog/8-natural-growth-boosters-promoters-for-broilers-that-actually-worked/) well-formulated feed, and plenty of water, etc.
I will be glad if you can share with us the weight of your broiler chicken at various weeks, let see what you got...
