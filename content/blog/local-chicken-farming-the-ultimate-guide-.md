So, you want to increase your local chicken farming productivity, but you don't know how to. If you don't aim to have a very high increase and improvement in your poultry farming productivity, then there is no essence of having the business.
To ensure you have the right, adequate increase in productivity in your poultry farm, consider the following:
#### **1\. Keep  PoultryFarm Records**
To better improve and keep track of productivity on your farm, you have to keep the proper [poultry farm records](/blog/how-to-keep-poultry-farm-record-for-layers/) of every farm activity. This record will also serve as a reference purpose should in case anything happens. It also enables you to understand and calculate the managing process for proper maintenance.
Here are a few lists of records you need to keep:
-   Total number of chicken bought
-   Records of chicken due for production
-   Number of isolated chickens
-   The total number of eggs hatched
-   Number of eggs that are broken
-   Amount of feed given to chicken per day
#### **2\. Join farmers' Support Group**
Farmer group helps to promote good production and marketing practices such as hatchery equipment like egg hatchers, better housing, better feeding, better health management, and collective marketing in order to improve yield thus increase incomes from poultry. You can look for one in your locality to join as it will help to facilitate marketing and enhance production.
#### **3\. Daily Sanitation**
You must ensure you carry out daily sanitation within your poultry farm, which will have a positive impact on your farm productivity. This will help in reducing the transmission of parasites and diseases in your poultry farm.
In particular, disinfect the chicken coop against mites, ticks, lice, etc, they are major life-threatening parasites in local (indigenous) chicken farming.
It is advisable to disinfect the nest after two consecutive hatchings by a hen to avoid mite infestation. You can use insecticide or heat by burning some dried grasses in the coop or nest boxes.
.Again, the chicken coop and run should be dried always to enable dust bathing which is a natural way chicken disinfect themselves. You can add wood ash to the coop as it is a natural disinfectant, and local chickens love dust bathing in it.
Feeders and drinkers should be thoroughly washed daily, and keep away from other animals to avoid contamination of deadly diseases.
#### **4\. Temperature Management**
Though we know local chicken have the tendency of surviving in very harsh weather conditions, that doesn't mean you should now expose them to such harsh weather conditions longer than they can endure as this can affect general productivity.
 For baby chicks, always ensure the temperature is within the range of 32 C - 35 C ( for the first week of life) and lowered by 0.2 C per day.
#### **5\. Invest in marketing**
Besides the high mortality rate, another big problem in local chicken farming and in poultry, in general, is **marketing**. Some farmers struggle to sell their birds after production, they hardly break even due to poor marketing strategies.
As I will always say, do not put production before marketing rather put marketing before production. In this way, you will not be stranded after production.
They are several ways you can [sell and market your local or indigenous chickens profitably](/blog/10-ways-to-sell-and-market-your-broiler-chickens-fast-that-are-proven-to-work/) like joining collectin marketing in a farmers support group, selling to retailers, have your own sales outlet, selling to schools and hotels, etc.

> A local hen brooding in a nest box
Naturally, a local hen has the tendency of hatching its chicks, which can occur 3 to 4 weeks of egg incubation (21 days). After that, the whole brooding will be done by the mother hen till the chicks pass the brooding stage. This type of brooding is the easiest.
Artificial brooding is done when the number of chicks that are needed to be raised is many. In this method, the chicks are supplied with artificial heat to keep them warm and intensive care is being given to them.
Equipment used for brooding under the artificial way is called brooders.
A brooder comprises mainly of three elements, namely:
1.  Heating Source: which can be either electric, gas-powered, solid fuel like charcoal, and liquid fuel like kerosene. This is usually used to supply heat to the chicks.
2.  Reflectors: these can also be called Hovers which are usually provided with heating elements, pilot lamp, heating mechanism, and thermometer in some cases in order to record the temperature.
3.  Brooder Guide: this is used to prevent chicks from scattering too far away from the heat supplied to them until they learn the source of the heat.
During the winter period, brooding is done for 5 - 6 days. While in the summer period, brooding is done in 2 - 3 weeks.
