What is a young male chicken called? In the vast realm of domesticated birds, there existed a captivating species known as Gallus domesticus - commonly referred to as chickens. These magnificent creatures featured a captivating range of colors, patterns, and sizes, with an astonishing array of over 150 different breeds.
But have you ever pondered where these intriguing beings come from? Legend has it that chickens trace their genealogy back to the [Red Junglefowl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl), a wild and lively bird who roamed the countries of India and Southeast Asia. Surprisingly, despite their alteration through domestication, both chickens and their wild forebears belong to the same biological species.
Throughout history, chickens have become an indispensable part of human society, serving a multitude of purposes.

The diverse range of chicken breeds only adds to the tapestry of their uses, captivating the hearts of people worldwide and inspiring a global phenomenon of chicken farming.

This hints at a more complex evolutionary history.
Regarding the chicken's scientific classification, there is ongoing debate among taxonomists and ornithologists. While some consider the chicken as a domesticated form of the wild Red Junglefowl (classified as G. gallus domesticus), others classify it as a subspecies of the Red Junglefowl.
[The U.S. Department of Agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Agriculture), for instance, categorizes the chicken as G. domesticus. Now, imagine yourself wandering through the enchanting world of agriculture, where chickens hold a pivotal role. Whether you are an aspiring poultry enthusiast or a seasoned farmer, understanding the peculiar terminology associated with different stages and genders of chickens is of paramount importance.
