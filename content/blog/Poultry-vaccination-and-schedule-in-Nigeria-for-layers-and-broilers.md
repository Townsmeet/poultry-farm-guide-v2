Poultry Vaccination is the first line of action in preventing poultry diseases, especially in Nigeria where highly pathogenic poultry diseases are prevalent. The prevalency of poultry diseases differs between regions/countries.
This is because some environmental factors like temperature and farmers' practices influence the distribution of these pathogens. Therefore it is pertinent you make use of a poultry vaccination schedule that suits your country/region.
In Nigeria however, most farmers in rural areas don’t vaccinate their birds, the few who do, don’t follow standard vaccination procedures, and such practices could lead to [vaccine failure](/blog/Poultry-vaccination-and-schedule%20for%20layers%20and%20Broilers/ "3 possible reasons for vaccine failure in poultry") as well as creating a breeding ground for endemic poultry diseases such as Newcastle disease, coccidiosis, Infectious bursal disease (IBD), Marek, Salmonella, etc.
 Nevertheless, in vaccinating your birds in Nigeria, you should make sure in the first 4 week
-   You vaccinate against the major diseases: ND, IBD, Marek, Salmonella. For the early onset of immunity to ensure protection.
-   In the next 10 weeks vaccinate against ND, IB, AE, Coryza, [fowlpox](/blog/fowl-pox-symptoms-treatment-and-prevention/), ILT, EDS, Salmonella- some of these vaccines may not be compulsory at this stage, except the disease is endemic or prevalent in your area.
-   Correct intervals between the various vaccinations are required. Find out from your supplier/hatchery, Instructions for vaccination.
The poultry vaccination schedule below is what I am using, and my birds have been doing just fine. But you should ask from your hatchery, most hatcheries in Nigeria have their vaccination schedules/programs with a slight difference in the time of administration.

For general poultry vaccination  schedule for layers and broilers, read **[Poultry Vaccination](/blog/Poultry-vaccination-and-schedule%20for%20layers%20and%20Broilers/)**
**Vaccination is incomplete without proper bio-security measures; I can confidently say that no farmer can get the best protection by implementing only one of these practices.**
