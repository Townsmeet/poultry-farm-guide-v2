##   **8 best poultry feeds in Nigeria with their prices**
In Poultry farming, 70% -80% of expenditures are incurred in poultry feeds. And of recent, the prices of poultry feeds are on the increase in the Nigerian market, mainly; due to the high cost of maize and other feed components.
Subsequently, most feed manufacturers are forced to increase their prices and others resulted in making use of substandard [feed ingredients](/blog/what-are-the-ingredients-of-poultry-feed/) to maintain price and keep their customers. Therefore, it is imperative as a poultry farmer, to buy feeds not only at an affordable price but feeds containing the right ingredients for better productivity
However, one of the challenges poultry farmers struggle with at this time is that no matter how costly the poultry feed is, you can hardly increase the prices of your birds, this is because the market expects you to sell at a certain price range irrespective of your cost input.

Moreover, as a farmer, you will want to get the best feeds at an affordable price, at least to make some profits yourself.
So, with these challenges in mind, I did a market survey (both offline and online market) to know how poultry farmers have been coping since the prices of feeds sky-rocketed.
At the end of my market survey, I came up with the top 8 feeds, although, I saw many other feeds I haven’t heard of or seen, I have to make do with the top 9. So, if your favorite feed is not among the top list, just know is based on farmers' (majorities) opinion and not mine. Surprisingly, some feeds that could have sat at the bottom of my personal list made the top 5. As the saying goes, the majority carries the vote.
Therefore, I present to you from my survey, the 9 best poultry feeds in Nigeria
