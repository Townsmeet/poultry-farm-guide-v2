One of the main reasons why most farmers run into lost in poultry farming is due to a lack of a proper poultry farm record. I doubt if there is any successful poultry farmer without a well-documented poultry farm record.
Poultry farm record helps you to keep track of your expenditure, profits and losses, and other activities in between production, which will help you to make an informed decision.
Therefore, records should be kept at all times from brooding to the end of each production cycle. Daily recording of activities is highly recommended.

Besides, records distinguishing the non-egg versus the egg production periods are recommended. Along with daily activity reports, the maintenance of a monthly expense and sales report is also recommended.

**Types of Poultry Record-Keeping for Layers**
### 1\. Poultry Record keeping for Non-Egg production Period (Weekly Activity Report)
The Non- egg production period is between the brooding, the grower, and the pullet stage, which is 1-18 or 20 weeks. (refer to Appendix A for a sample weekly activity report ) Some of the important activities are worth recording include
a) Hour spent – Note the approximate number of hours you spend in your farm activities ( feeding, cleaning, egg collection, etc )
b) Daily feed consumption- Generally expressed in kilograms (kg)
c) Water usage- Give estimated liters or gallons
d) Bird weights- Random selection of a few birds to determine an average weight
e) [Vaccinations and medications](/blog/Poultry-vaccination-and-schedule%20for%20layers%20and%20Broilers/)\- Note types and amount.

### **Working Out A Profit or Bookkeeping**
**You** need to work out what your profit is to make sure your business is successful. To do this you must take your costs away from the income or money you receive for selling eggs or old layers
This also means that you need to keep written records of all the money you spend and the sales you make.

### **Record Of Costs**
Remember you have two different lots of costs, production or on-going costs and establishment or setup costs.
You can add up all your production costs and take them away from your income but don't take all the establishment costs off your income.
The establishment costs are a big cost and the items you buy will last a long time so you must spread these cost over that time. First add up all your establishment costs. Then work out how long these things will last e.g 5 years then divide the total by the number of years.
Then deduct the part of establishment costs from your year's income.

In conclusion, you should cultivate the culture of proper bookkeeping and extend the same to your farm employees for optimal output. If you are computer savvy, you can set up a poultry farm record sheet, poultry farm accounting sheet with your PC using excel.
Save your records in the cloud ( using Google Drive or Drop box) in case you misplace your hard copy you can easily recover it- the world has gone digital and we all have to upgrade ourselves technically.
I am wishing a successful and a profitable poultry farming
