As a Poultry farmer, having the established knowledge that humans are not the only ones that like chicken and poultry birds will enable you to plan well on how to safeguard your chicken.
Aside from humans, there are lots of creatures who feed on chickens. There are some who deliberately search for these chickens to feed on. These creatures are known as chicken predators.
Below is a full list containing the most common chicken predators, their signs, their mode of Killing, and the perfect way to prevent them.

## **20\. Dogs**

**![dog as chicken predator](<https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Dog+(1).jpg>)**
Dogs have been recognized as one of the friendliest animals to have around. They are widely used as pets and friendly, even to the newborn baby, but are great predators of chicken

#### **Mode of attack**

Dogs when attacking the poultry birds run after them and refuse to quit the Chase even when asked to. As a Poultry farmer, once you see such a situation, and firm desire from the dogs when chasing the birds, Please look for a way to break that chase because your bird might be under attack.

Cats are not real dangers to fully grown and matured chickens because of height and defense mechanisms. But can be a potential danger to chicks.

#### **Mode of Attack**

For cats that attack both mature chickens and chicks, they look for little opportunity to attack the prey, pounce on it and eat off only the fleshy part leaving the feathers.

#### **How to Prevent cats**

The best way to prevent cats from Killing your chicken and chicks is to keep them in a safe place that is beyond the reach of cats.

## **18\. Snakes**

**![snake as chicken predator](<https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/snake+(1).jpg>)**
Snakes often kill a chicken for food. Naturally, snakes are not the primary predators for chickens ( most there for the eggs and chicks ) but when they go hungry and there's a chicken around them, they try to feed on the chicken forgetting that it will not be easy to swallow an adult chicken.

#### **Mode of Attack**

The easiest way for a snake to kill any prey including the snake is to wound itself and stretch itself, spitting itself out with a force like a thrown Stone till it reaches and bites the prey.

#### **How to Prevent Snakes**

The most effective way of preventing snakes from Killing or eating your chicken is to cover all the holes they might be able to enter with your Poultry with a net that is too tiny for the snakes to pass through.

## **17\. Hawks**

**![Hawk as chicken predator](<https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Hawk+(1).jpg>)**
When listing the top 5 most deadly chicken predators and you miss out on hawks, it, therefore, means that list is biased. Hawks happen to be one of the major concerns for every Poultry farmer.

#### **Mode of Attack**

Hawks have sharp eyes that can see far objects. They fix their gaze on the prey even though they are settled on any tree far away from where their prey is. They observe the prey for a while and with a swift movement, they fly down picking the chicken.

To properly Prevent snakes you should also ensure you have anything in the form of a scarecrow that makes noise. The noise tends to deceive the hawk giving it a false impression that you are currently at the farm even though you're not.
You can also place a reflective tape or any reflective object on top of their protective net. A reflective object startle hawks and they tend to avoid it.

Mode of Attack
Rats rarely attack chickens because their main motive for entering your poultry farm is the feed you give to your chickens. Although, they can eat and feed on a weak chicken while they sleep.
The chicken will not notice at the beginning because they will blow the wound to give a feeling of pleasure while they feed on the chicken. By the time the chicken will notice the rat might have done a lot of damage that could lead to death.
