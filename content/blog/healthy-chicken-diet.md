Feeding your chickens a balanced diet is essential for their health, egg production, and overall well-being. This guide covers everything you need to know about chicken nutrition.

## Essential Nutrients

Chickens require a balanced diet that includes:

- Protein for growth and egg production (16–20% for layers)
- Carbohydrates for energy
- Fats for energy and nutrient absorption
- Vitamins and minerals (especially calcium for strong eggshells)
- Grit to help with digestion

> Good nutrition is the foundation of a resilient, productive flock.

### Feed Types by Life Stage

1. Starter (0–8 weeks) — High protein (20–24%), crumbles for easy eating
2. Grower (8–16 weeks) — Moderate protein (16–18%) to support steady growth
3. Layer (16+ weeks) — ~16% protein with added calcium for eggshells

| --------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Protein   | Growth, feathering, egg laying | Soybean meal, fish meal    |
| Carbs     | Daily energy                   | Corn, wheat, barley        |
| Fats      | Energy, nutrient absorption    | Vegetable oil, seeds       |
| Calcium   | Strong eggshells               | Oyster shell, limestone    |
| Vitamins  | Metabolism, immunity           | Premix in commercial feeds |

### Treats (In Moderation)

- Leafy greens, squash, peas

- Moldy or spoiled food

### Watering Tips

- Keep water clean and shaded in summer
- Use heated waterers in winter to prevent freezing

#### Example Config (YAML)

```yaml
feed:
  layer:
    protein: 16
    calcium: high
  grower:
    protein: 18
  starter:
    protein: 20-24
schedule:
  morning: fresh feed, water check
  evening: treat rotation, coop lockup
```

#### Inline Code

Use `1/4 cup` oyster shell per 5 hens as a free-choice supplement.
