**Plastic chicken coops are not just made of normal plastic, but with cozy and good weather/pest-proof plastic materials which prevent the habitation of red mites which are normally found in woody chicken coops. It also permits easy access for cleaning and maintenance. However, with all these advantages listed above and many more, a plastic chicken coop is good but comes with its own “Achilles heel”**
Over the years, there have been several debates of wood vs. plastic chicken coop with woody coop having the upper hand, not because it is the best but probably because wood is more accessible and less costly.
But we cannot deny the aesthetics and longevity of plastic chicken coop. Nevertheless, both come with their pros and cons, but today, I am will be a fan of plastic chicken coops and we going to look at how good they, their maintenance and management, plus the recommendation of some good plastic chicken coop in the market.
## **What are the Benefits of Plastic Chicken Coops?**
The benefits of plastic chicken coop are numerous:
· Very strong and very robust
· Protects against vermin getting in.
· So much easier to clean out and get rid of red mite.
· It won't rot
· Less maintenance
A good plastic chicken coop may last for up to twenty years. As I noted earlier it will not rot. Wood that's perpetually exposed to the weather can eventually rot and degrade. Plastic simply doesn’t have this downside. If you're trying to find longevity in your choice of chicken coop then you have got to shop for a plastic one – it may be a no-brainer!
The biggest killer of wood chicken coops is moving them. If you intend to move them so the chickens have fresh grass every few days, don’t get a wood one. even though it's wheels.
Wood within the cold shrinks and in the heat can expand. This means over barely a year, joints can begin to weaken and should fall apart. Then, add in moving it now and then, even with the slightest low push and it will become a candidate for ruin. It's easy, with a plastic scoop, you'll avoid all of this.
 In just five years I went through three wood coops with wheels, I learned the laborious method – through my pocket.
## **Do plastic chicken coops get red mite?**
I need to be honest. shopping for a plastic coop will not mean you will not ever get red mite, however, I am not saying you'll either. some people assume by having a plastic coop they will not get red mite as there aren’t the cracks or joints in a very plastic coop like there are in wood ones. Slightly untrue…
I can say this – it is less probably that you simply will get red mite in a very plastic coop and much easier to get rid of after you do.
Removing red mite from your plastic coop is a lot easier as a result of there are fewer places for them to hide, and you can rid of them by using a [good mite spray](<iframe style="width:120px;height:240px;" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=US&source=ac&ref=tf_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=samchi8k-20&marketplace=amazon&amp;region=US&placement=B072YVN9XW&asins=B072YVN9XW&linkId=ba1bbdbcafa1761901bfb4e431bf4e30&show_border=false&link_opens_in_new_window=false&price_color=333333&title_color=0066c0&bg_color=ffffff">     </iframe>), or [miteBgone dried herbs, you can it from amazon](https://amzn.to/3uOALDA) ( it is safe for your child and chicken). Wood can have knots where they're going to hide, wood was joints and edges and screw holes, etc – you get what I am saying. a decent plastic coop doesn’t have all those problems.
## **How do I clean and manage my plastic chicken coop?**
Which is easier to wipe down and sterilize, wood or plastic? It's plastic. everybody is aware of this thus I am not aiming to bang on about this too much. however I will be able to say decent hen coop keeping, i.e. cleaning out and checking it over ought to be done frequently. The state of the coop can speak volumes concerning the health of the birds. If you don’t clean out the chicken poop it will cause respiration issues with the birds because it is high in ammonia.
Clean the coop frequently and you'll not have any issues. So having a plastic coop to wash vs. a wooden one can save you time and therefore backache.
## **How protective is plastic chicken coop against Predator?**
Remember I earlier mentioned I had three wood coops on wheels, well the bottom isn’t consistently even. therefore on slightly unflat ground, the coop was putting a lot of weight on some areas and not others. Over time this stress and was slightly raising the wood panel within the corner. solely by perhaps a ¼”.
What happened then was rats were able to get in. They were feeding on the chicken feed and drinking their water. Then once they'd created that crack slightly larger from running in and out at night for a few weeks and which also permits entry for squirrel
 Remember this all started from a small crack in one wood panel that was being raised ever slightly on uneven ground. Then we tended to have a draft, and not being careful will cause chickens to catch colds. It required repairing, therefore, that’s trouble and repair expenses you don’t wish.
A plastic chicken coop that is well made is protective and safer against vermin like raccoons and foxes. Another predator may rip with their mouth and scratch that their paws and claws at a wood coop and probably get in. No animals may bite or paw through the plastic.
