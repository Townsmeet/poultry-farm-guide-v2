Over the years livestock experts and nutritionists have tirelessly sorted and researched alternatives feed ingredients for corn and soybeans, which are extensively used in formulating livestock feed, especially for poultries and pigs.
Despite some hindrances like anti-nutritional factors, unavailability, palatability, etc,  associated with these feed alternatives,  there has been some progress in this aspect. For example,  15 % oat in combination with barley can replace corn without affecting overall performance. In the same vine, [(Abdulrashid and Agwuaobi, 2009),](/blog/alternative-poultry-feed-ingredients-a-solution-to-high-feed-prices/) reported that cocoyam meal will effectively replace maize at 25% (raw sundried) and 50% (boiled sundried) as a major source of energy in the diets of broiler finishers.
However, one of the major setbacks is the anti-nutritional factors found in these feed alternatives, but notwithstanding, nutritional experts have been able to produce some enzymes capable of enhancing the digestibility of these feed alternatives.
ok, enough of the intro...
So, in this post, I will show you the latest feed alternatives for maize and soybeans, their anti-nutritional factors, the amount in percentage that can be used, and the source. However, in this episode, the alternative feed ingredients are more common in America and Europe, and to a lesser extent in some parts of Asia and Africa.  You can see alternative feed ingredients common in Africa [here.](/blog/alternative-feed-ingredients-for-corn-and-soybeans/)
Ok, let continue...

## **Alternative Feed Ingredients for Corn**
-   Grain Sorghum (Milo)
-   Wheat
-   Barley
-   Triticale
### 1\. **Grain Sorghum (Milo)**
**![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Red+and+white+sorghum.png)**
-   7-9% protein, 1400 Kcal/lb
-    The most suitable replacement for corn.
-   Feeding value is essentially 95–96% the same as corn
-   Limitation: tannin content
-   The red or rusty color of the seed = higher tannins
-   White or light varieties have fewer tannins which allow feeding higher levels
-   Should be limited to 30-40% of the total diet based on the tannin content
### **2.Wheat**
**![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Wheat.jpg)**
-    9-16% protein, 1440 kcal/lb
-   Hard, red spring wheat varieties tend to have higher protein •
-   Soft, white winter varieties lower protein
-   Limitations: Pentosans content and the lack of Xylanase enzymes produced by the poultry digestive tract
-   Diets should be limited to 30% for young poultry and 50% for mature poultry
### **3. Triticale**
**![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Tricale.png)**
-   11-13% protein, 1400 kcal/lb
-    Hybrid of wheat and rye
-   **Limitations:** Pentosans content and the lack of Xylanase enzymes produced by the poultry digestive tract
-   Similar to wheat
-   Diets should be limited to 30% for young poultry and 50% for mature poultry

### **4. Barley**
**![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Barley.png)**
-   11-12% protein, 1250 kcal/lb
-   **Limitations:** are due to β-Glucan content of barley, 5-8%
-   Should be limited to 15 – 20% of the diet
-   May be fed at higher levels if βGlucanase enzymes are added to the diet
## **Alternatives Feed Ingredients to Soy**
-   Peas
-   Fish Meal
-   Linseed Meal
-   Sunflower Meal
-   Camelina Meal
-   Crab Meal
-   Sesame Meal
-   No-Soy Protein Blend
## **1. Peas (Field, Cow, Cull)**
**![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Peas.jpg)**
-   22 – 24% CP, 1300 kcal/lb average energy
-   **Limitations:**
-        Low Sulfur Amino Acids
-        Tannins- higher tannin varieties will reduce protein digestibility
-          6% reduction for every 1% of tannins
-    Limited to 20 – 25% in most poultry diets

### 2.**Fish Meal**
**![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Fish.jpg)**
-   58 – 72% protein, 1280 – 1550 kcal/lb
**Limitations to feeding**:
-       High oil varieties-Herring, Menhaden, and Anchovies may cause off flavoring due to the fish oil
-   High oil meals, should not exceed 5% of the ration
-   Low oil varieties-Catfish meal, comes from farm-raised catfish. May contain higher levels of contaminants, antibiotics, or heavy metals
### **3.Linseed (Flax) Meal**
![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Linseed.png)
-   30-37% protein, 1100-1300 Kcal/lb
-    Generally only used in ruminant feed. If kept fresh and not oxidized, works well in poultry and swine feeds.
-   **Limitations:** off flavoring
             Fish flavor or paint like smell from the high oil content at levels above 30%
-    Can be fed up to 20% of the diet safely without off flavoring • Use caution in combination with fishmeals and other high Omega 3 oils!
### **4.Sunflower Meal**
**![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sunflower.png)**
-   34-38% CP, 1000 – 1100 Kcal/lb

-   When fresh, can be used up to 10 -15% of the diet
### **5.Camelina Meal**
![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Camelina.png)
-   37% CP, 1510 Kcal/lb
-   The byproduct of the oilseed industry
-   It has the protein and energy of roasted soybeans after the oil has been removed
-   Limited by the FDA to not exceed 10% of Layer and Broiler diets, 2% for swine
-   So far, does not appear to oxidize quickly and cause feed refusal
### **6.Crab Meal**
**![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Crab.png)**
-   30-36% CP, 900-1100 kcal/lb
-   A byproduct of the food industry
-    **Limitations:** high salt, low energy
-     Usually between 2-3 salt from natural sources
-   Very low availability in most areas

![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Sesame.png)
-   42% CP, 1025kcal/lb ME
-   Similar amino acid profile to soybean meal
-   Lower lysine, higher methionine
-   Low in isoleucine, leucine
-   A byproduct of oil see the industry
-   **Limitations:** Phytic acid, which inhibits calcium absorption
-   Up to 10-12% of broiler diet • 15% of grower/finisher pigs
In conclusion, these alternative feed ingredients can not completely replace corn and soybeans due to their anti-nutritional contents. So, in using them you have to consider their limitations. Although, most of these alternatives are not largely distributed around the globe, which is one of the challenges limiting their use. Nevertheless, I hope other regions like Asia and Africa have potential feed ingredients untapped. So, it is left for the research institutions to carry out analysis on them and present their profile as those presented in this article.
