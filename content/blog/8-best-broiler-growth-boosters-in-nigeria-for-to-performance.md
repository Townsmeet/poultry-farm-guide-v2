The common goal of every broiler poultry farmer is to achieve the desired market size as fast as possible and within a specific time frame in other to maximize profit and satisfy customers' needs in a very competitive market. Consequently, this has lead many farmers to desperately look for ways to achieving this result within a short time with minimum cost.
And again, veterinary nutritionists and feed manufacturers have taken advantage of the situation to produce feed and vitamin supplements that are believed to increase broiler chicken's size and weight, thus, the name **Broiler growth booster.**

## **What is a broiler Growth booster?**

A broiler growth booster could be any drug or substance that encourages, improves, or promote the performance of broiler chickens, eg [vitamins and minerals](/blog/6-best-multivitamins-for-poultry-in-nigeria/), [some natural growth booster,](/blog/8-natural-growth-boosters-promoters-for-broilers-that-actually-worked/) antibiotics, etc. These broiler growth boosters are mostly in liquid or powder (water-soluble) form formulated by a veterinarian nutritionist. A good broiler growth booster should be a mixture of a balanced blend of vitamins, minerals, electrolytes amino acids, probiotics to help strengthen the bone and develop muscles rapidly. Unfortunately, most of the products in the market are short of this quality blend.
Please wait! I know you are eager to see the best broiler growth booster list, but I want to correct a misconception before I proceed to the top best broiler growth boosters in Nigeria.

## **What is the Misconception?**

Most farmers think that growth booster is the “holy grail” to fast and rapid growth for broiler chickens. I often hear farmers ask, what is the best growth booster for broiler? I want my broiler to grow bright red wattle and comb, what drug or booster can I get, and when I hear these things I shake my head in dismay at what misinformation can cause. Booster is not a magic spare for rapid growth, however, they are a hand full of effective boosters in the market, despite many junks out there called growth boosters.
A growth booster will not be effective if the chicken is sick, if it has a poor genetic make-up, if the feed quality is poor , if the welfare and management are below standard. Moreover, your broiler doesn’t need a growth booster if all these conditions are met. Growth booster is just the icing of the cake in broiler management. It is not a must, and not necessarily in attaining the [expected weight of your broiler chicken](/blog/expected-weight-of-broiler-chicken-are-you-getting-it-right/).

> However, if you must use a growth booster, I advise you to consult your vet for proper prescription and withdrawal time. Besides, I asked for the opinion of broiler farmers in our Facebook group for their opinion of the best broiler growth booster in Nigeria. There were a few products mentioned, while some shared my opinion on the non-compulsory use of broiler growth booster.
> From all the data I gathered, I have narrowed it down to 8 best broiler growth boosts in Nigeria (of course you have the right to object my list), although, we have other boosters that are very good as well, but l have to make do with the available data I have based on peoples’ opinion, my experience and extensive research on some few growth boosters. I placed the 8 boosters into 3 categories;

- Category 3 are those mentioned by broiler farmers on social media
- Category 2 are the ones I have used in my broiler farm, and
- Category 1 are those ones that have undergone extensive experiment and have been proven to be effective.
  Ok, enough of the talk, let get down to the list
