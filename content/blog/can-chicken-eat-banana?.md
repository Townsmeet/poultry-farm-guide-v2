Banana peel is the fleshly pigmented outer coat of a banana.
 The peel of banana is also edible just like the inner part of a banana. The peel is also packed with a lot of vitamins ( vitamins B6 and B12), and minerals (magnesium and potassium).
Plus, it is rich in fiber and protein, along with carotenoids, polyphenols, etc. So, yes, your chickens can eat banana peels
 However, like other fruit peels, it may contain some trace of [**anti-nutritional factors**](https://publications.waset.org/10009238/nutritional-and-anti-nutritional-composition-of-banana-peels-as-influenced-by-microwave-drying-methods) ( like phytates, alkaloids, oxalates, and hydrogen cyanides), which may be detrimental to the health of your chickens.

## **How to Prepare Banana peels for your Chickens?**
One of the best ways to prepare banana peel for your chickens is by applying heat. [Research has shown](https://publications.waset.org/10009238/nutritional-and-anti-nutritional-composition-of-banana-peels-as-influenced-by-microwave-drying-methods) that heat (broiling or microwaving) helps to reduce the anti-nutrients in banana peel and make it more palatable.
Here, you have to boil the peels up until they become tender. You can preserve them by sun-drying them or simply microwave them.
To make it more palatable and attractive, cut them into little pieces. You will see how your chickens will savor them with delight because chickens love to pick their foods.

 Moreover, the entire banana is a unique delicacy to chickens. Chickens prefer the over-ripe bananas. One method to cut down feed costs and to provide this treatment to your chickens is to check local fruit and vegetable stores and even wholesalers in your location.
They usually pay to get rid of over-ripe fruit; a hand full of people love over-ripe bananas. It could be a win-win situation for the seller, you, and your chickens you pick some baskets of over-ripe bananas periodically.

### Nutritional Benefits of Bananas
Here are some [nutritional benefits of bananas](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339736792_A_Comprehensive_Review_on_Nutritional_Value_Medicinal_Uses_and_Processing_of_Banana) to your chickens
-   It is rich in carbohydrates (22.84 g/100 g), provides the energy of about 370 kJ/100 g, and is considered to be one of the [best sources of potassium (358 mg/100 g)**\-2**](%202. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/87559129.2020.1725890)
-   It is rich in **vitamin B6**. This vitamin helps the nervous system to function properly. It is used in the synthesis of norepinephrine and serotonin, which are happy hormones.
-   It is a good source of **magnesium**, which is an essentials supplement. With this mineral, your chickens will have increased energy, a healthy heart, plus other advantages like soothing effects and good sleep.
-   **Other dietary Essentials:** A finger of banana contains 89 calories per banana, 0.3 grams of fat, (comprises of saturated, monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, omega-3, and omega-6 fats), 1.1 grams of protein, 75% water, and 22.8 grams of carbs comprises of sugar and fiber.
With all these goodies I don’t see reasons while you cannot feed your chickens bananas. Chickens love the main banana itself and you don’t need to boil to prepare it-peel and serve, they can as well peck through the outer cover.
If you are worried about cost and consistency, you can ask local sellers for over-ripe bananas, and they will be more glad to give them to you.

## **Side Effects of Chickens Eating Banana**
There are a lot of health benefits in feeding your chickens bananas, but it is not always safe when to use them wrongly. For instance, high sugar content in bananas can be unsafe for your chickens when abuse.
Chickens cannot process that much sugar, and banana don’t meet the dietary needs of chicken feed.
In addition, since chickens can’t process wet food to get the whole nutrient therein,  and at the same time, they also get the harmful part of it easily. Therefore, you should not over-feed your chicken banana, only give in a small amount.
Also, with the peel, ensure you boil/heat the peel very well to reduce the anti-nutritional factors in it. And remember that pesticides are major pollutants on the peels.

Although, these side effects can’t deter the fact that banana is a good treat to your chicken, and if you still ask me the question ‘can chickens eat a banana?” my answer is still a big Yes!.
If you want to know if your chicken love bananas just toss some cuts into their run and see for yourself. At first, they might curiously run to it and have a few picks, if they find it palatable they will savor it with joy.
Some might not like it as an adult bird since they weren’t raised with it, while some don’t care. To curb this, you can introduce the banana to your chicken as they mature; in that way their system will get used to it.
