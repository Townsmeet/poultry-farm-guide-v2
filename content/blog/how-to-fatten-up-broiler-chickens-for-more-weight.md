If you are talking about a broiler and you have not mentioned weight, bro! you are not talking about broiler, I will assume you are talking about quail. Never mind, consumers are willing to pay more for heavy and weighty broilers. The main objective of raising a broiler is to hit the "target weight". as early as possible, but sometimes we fail to achieve this target due to some known or unknown causes.
However, we still have to sell our birds, and nobody will want to buy a broiler that looks like a cockerel. So, in this post, I am going to share with you  4 simple steps to fatten up your broiler, although, they are [several ways to fatten up broiler chickens](/blog/8-ways-on-how-to-make-broiler-chicken-grow-faster/), I prefer this method I am going to share with you.

#### **Note**:
Fattening up a broiler chicken will most likely yield disappointing results if the birds don't have a good amount of flesh, muscle,  and strong bones. So, it is pertinent you feed your broilers high-quality starter and grower feed to ensure they could be able to shoulder the weight that could result from fattening the broilers.
#### **My Recipes**
-   Roasted soybeans: Heating it will not only help in destroying the anti-nutritional factor ( trypsin inhibitor) but also improve it palatability.
-   Corn
-   Groundnut cake,  GNC, or roasted groundnut ( just a little roasting)
-   Palm kernel cake, PKC, (optional)
-   Fish meal, FM, (optional)

## **Step 1**
Mix the fattening ingredients, corn, soybeans, and groundnut cake in the following ratio 2: 1: 1. For example, 2 kg of corn,n1kg of soybeans, and 1kg of GNC. Then for PKC and FM, you can add 1/4kg 1/2kg respectively. The mixture will form a mash.
## **Step 2**
Fill the feeding trough with the mash and provide plenty of water along with each feeding. Feed the birds lightly for the first week three times a day, giving them less meal than they would consume entirely, thus leaving them slightly hungry in preparation for the following weeks.
## **Step 3**
Clean and empty the feeding troughs when the chickens have finished feeding. After the first week, feed the birds twice a day as much food as they can eat.
## **Step 4**
Supply your broiler chickens with plenty of fresh clean water at least twice a day.

### **Remember:**
This is my personal method of fattening up broiler chickens. At times, it comes with its own problems, especially the issue of overweight leading to lameness. So, use your discretion. In general, it has yielded a lot of positive results than negative ones.
