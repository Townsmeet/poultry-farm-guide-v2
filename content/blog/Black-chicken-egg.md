## **Do Any Chickens Lay Black Egg?**
 You may have come across beautiful black chicken eggs trending around the internet at some point and this left you with a dream of adding them among your different eggs archive basket.
But, I hate to disappoint you, that is all that they are- an illusion.
Black chicken eggs do not exist unless you transform them with color, which is obtainable.
Having seen a lot of them circulating on social media, there is a reason this rumor got started. Despite the eggs are not black, the chickens are ( they are just as beautiful as those fake black chicken eggs).
## **Ayam Cemani: The Black Chicken Egg Chicken**

You may also be overwhelmed and skeptical by the photos of a whole black chicken, but they actually exist-it is called the Ayam Cemani (**Indonesian** black chicken ). The whole body of the chicken has black pigmentation, including the feather, beak comb, and skin.
That is not all; the meat and bones of the chicken are also black in color, making it a wonderful delicacy for high-end restaurants.
On a closer look, there there are hints of blue on the Ayam Cemani’s feathers, it is a sight to behold, and people will be willing to pay a pretty dollar for this rare chicken breed. Moreover, most of these chickens can sell for nothing less than $50 per chick.
Also, most breeders enthusiasts have found a pretty interesting niche. But trustworthy breeders will be sincere enough to tell that the Ayam Cemani doesn’t lay pitch-black eggs.
In fact, the eggs of the Ayam Cemani chickens are cream in color.
## **Reasons for the Black Chicken Egg Rumour is The Ayam Cemani Chicken**
However, it makes sense if the chicken’s beak, body, meat, etc.,  are black, then the eggs should also be black as well, right?
Unluckily, you can only imagine the dismay of bringing home a new Ayam Cemani with the high expectation of a black egg only to find a cream-colored egg in its place.
The worse is that some breeders allow buyers to believe that their chicken’s eggs will be black. In fact, there are several articles circulating this belief.
With all things said and done, you should endeavor to research your breed before buying in order to avoid disappointment when your hens start laying their first eggs.

## **The Genetics Reasons Behind the Black Chicken**
Despite the black egg rumor, the Ayam Cemani will catch the attention of any chicken lover. Many chickens may possess a different color combination, but none is pigmented in as many places as this beautiful chicken.
The research was carried out by [National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/why-black-chickens-fibromelanosis#close) to unveil the mysteries behind the pitch-black chicken and the reason for the black pigmentation.
Here, is what they discovered, “Most vertebrates have a gene known endothelin 3, or EDN3, which, among other things, controls skin color. And when a normal chicken is developing, certain cells like those in the skin and feather follicles, express EDN3, which trigger the migration of melanoblast, or the cells that go on to create color”
I know it is a lot to comprehend, especially with those who are not interested in genetics. Bust still, the explanation is helpful to those who are scientifically inclined.
