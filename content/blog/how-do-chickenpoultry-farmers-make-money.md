*A chicken keeper feeding her backyard birds grains*
The phrase Chicken farmer is interchangeable with poultry farmer which means a farmer who keeps or rear domesticated fowls such as chickens, ducks, turkeys, quail, etc, for the sole aim of making a profit, while to a lesser extent to keep them as pets or do it as a hobby.
As a chicken farmer or poultry farmer, your poultry products should be able to take care of your homestead and your farm’s bills and even have some money to keep for yourself.
On our school farm, we ensure that at least the farm produce is able to take care of bills like electricity, water, , security, sanitation levy, etc. In addition, it serves as a learning ground for our students. Most of them do pick up interest to study Animal or chicken-related course in the university.
 I Later borrowed a leaf that one can also make money from chicken by simply providing an online class or writing an ebook because people are now developing  interest in poultry farming, and obviously they will be needing  some guide, which you can provide and charge them for it.

So, in this post I am going to share with you 8 ways you can make money from your chickens.
## **1.Selling of Eggs**
![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/eggs+pexel.jpg)
Selling chicken eggs one of the most profitable ways to make money from your chicken. If you are a hobby chicken keeper and you don’t know what to do with your surplus eggs, you can decide to sell them to at least maintain your [chicken coop.](https://amzn.to/3gGhBvp)
Furthermore, if you intend to go to commercial production as a side hustle then you really have to raise laying breeds that can lay about 300-350 eggs per annum.  I have written separate posts for [cost and profit from rearing 200 layers](/blog/cost-of-raising-200-layers-in-nigeria-with-profit-amount/) and [cost and profit from rearing 1000 layers.](/blog/cost-of-raising-1000-layers-in-nigeria-with-profit-amount/) From the analysis,  you will be making a profit of approximately $6,000 from 1000 layers in 12 months.
## 2\. **FERTILE EGGS**
![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Chicks+and+eggs.jpg)
Another way your laying hens can bring in a profit to your hobby farm or backyard farm is by selling fertile eggs for hatching. Some people find it difficult to tame  and keep a rooster, so, they will usually buy fertilized eggs from local shops. So,   If you’re lucky enough to be able to keep a rooster in your flock…well he’ll do the hard work for you, and you can sell direct to homesteaders or supply to local shops in your vicinity.
 Also, you’ll be able to sell fresh hatching eggs to this neighbor and interested buyers. It will help to have one breed of chickens so that you get purebred eggs but you can sell a barnyard mix too.
On our school farm, we have about three roosters to  20 hens which lay pretty large numbers of fertilized eggs, although we don’t hatch them, the hens are good sitters so they do the hatching themselves, where you have poor sitters you can sell the Fertile eggs to those who needs them. Fertile eggs from purebred chickens will get a high price, especially if they are a rare breed.  You’ll just need to collect your eggs regularly and *store them safely*.

## **3\. Selling Day-Old CHICKS**
**![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/chicks-2965846_1280.jpg)**
Selling day-old chicks is another great way to make money with chickens. I could remember my grand mum do sell off her chicks every *eke* market day. Also at this stage, You have very little expense invested into to the chicks, and [**your incubator**](https://amzn.to/35E7wsI), if automatic, will do most of the work as well.
It is a good marketing practice to check for an interesting market before you sell your eggs. Some potential buyers will be other homesteaders, farmers, feed, and farm supply stores. You can facilitate you selling by  advertising them on social medial groups and forums- again, have purebred chicks to offer.
If you do not know [*how* to *sex chicks*](/blog/how-do-you-know-if-a-chick-is-a-male-or-female/) you can sell them as straight-run, which means they can be either hens or roos. [You can hatch eggs in less than 30 days](/blog/How-to-hatch-chicks-naturally-at-your-backyard-farm/). You may want to consider having multiple incubators  for starting a larger chick production- that is how major hatcheries started.
## 4\. **PULLETS**
Another option for  to earn money as a chicken farmer  is by raising pullets. Pullets are hens under the age of one and near their laying time or already laying. Many backyard farmers/ homesteaders don’t want to raise chicks due to the stress usually associated with [brooding](http://poultryfarmguide.com/blog/ultimate-guide-for-brooding-broiler-in-nigeria/) or the equipment needed. While others cannot afford to wait for months to getting them laying eggs.
Your customers will be willing to pay more for a point of lay hen or hen already laying eggs. A pullet could be sold for $5 to $20 depending on the age and breed. Your time and expense should be taken into consideration when deciding on a price and if this is the right profit for you. You’ll need a considerable amount of space, preferably deep litter.

##### *Broiler chickens*
The most common breed of bird for this purpose is your broiler chickens**.** Broiler chickens are hybrid breed created to grow fast with a lot of breast meat within 6 to 8 weeks of age. Meat production is one of the fastest ways to make money as a chicken farmer.

Such background check include knowing your target market and the types of breeds they prefer. Also, you should also learn [how to market and sell your broilers](/blog/10-ways-to-sell-and-market-your-broiler-chickens-fast-that-are-proven-to-work/) before going into production. Never you put production before marketing, because you might get stranded.

However, farmers who don’t have space to rear meat birds but can butcher and process them can as well patronize you. It is important to consider breed, feed, free-ranging, etc. All these considerations can change the price you can ask for a full-grown chicken.
Majority raise the [**Cornish Cross**](https://imperfectlyhappy.com/free-range-cornish-cross/) meat birds of their fast growing nature (less time for you) while others would prefer to purchase heirloom breeds.
## **6 . Sell Chicken Manure**
