Are you considering getting backyard chickens, but you're unsure about how many laying hens to purchase? Picture waking up to the calming clucks and the promise of fresh eggs right in your backyard. Raising chickens can be a fulfilling and sustainable addition to your family's lifestyle.
But before you start on this feathered adventure, you might be wondering, "How many chickens should I get for my family?" The number of eggs a chicken produces depends on its breed. Common varieties like the Rhode Island Red or Oxford Brown lay around 310 eggs per year.
At the higher end of the scale, the [Australorp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australorp) lays an average of 320 eggs per year (some have even been known to lay 364 per year!). On average, a chicken lays about 270 eggs per year, with a slowdown or stoppage during the winter months.
If you're thinking about getting backyard chickens but aren't sure how many laying hens to buy, we can help you calculate how many eggs your household consumes and how many chickens you'll need to produce that same number of eggs. Dual-purpose breed hens typically lay 4-6 eggs per week. Mediterranean breed hens, like [Leghorns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leghorn_chicken), typically lay 5-7 eggs per week, with some individuals taking a day off every 8 days.
For example, if your family typically uses a full dozen eggs each week, 3 young laying hens will provide you with 12 to 18 fresh eggs every week. If your family relies on eggs as a primary source of protein, historical pioneers found that having two to three hens per family member was enough to provide everyone with eggs for one meal a day and still have extra eggs for daily baking.
Having additional hens will allow you to share fresh eggs with family and neighbors. This comprehensive guide by [Poultry Farm Guide](https://www.poultryfarmguide.com/) will not only answer your question but also explore the reasons for keeping chickens and the best breeds for various purposes.
