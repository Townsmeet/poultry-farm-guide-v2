Raising backyard chickens can be a rewarding experience, providing you with fresh eggs, natural pest control, and delightful feathered friends. This guide will help you get started on your poultry-keeping journey.

## Choosing the Right Breed

When selecting chickens, consider:

- Egg production (e.g., Leghorns, Rhode Island Reds)
- Temperament (docile breeds work well for families)
- Climate tolerance (match breeds to your local weather)

> A well-chosen breed can make flock management easier and more enjoyable.

### Quick Comparison

| Breed            | Temperament | Eggs/Year | Climate   |
| ---------------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- |
| Rhode Island Red | Active      | ~250      | Versatile |
| Australorp       | Calm        | ~280      | Cooler    |
| Leghorn          | Flighty     | ~300      | Warmer    |

## Housing and Setup

A good chicken coop should provide:

- Protection from predators
- Ventilation to prevent respiratory issues
- Nesting boxes (one per 3–4 hens)
- Roosting bars for sleeping
- Adequate space (3–4 sq ft per bird inside, 8–10 sq ft in the run)

## Daily Care

1. Feed a balanced layer ration (16–18% protein)
2. Provide fresh, clean water at all times
3. Offer grit and oyster shell as needed
4. Spot-clean bedding; replace regularly
5. Observe flock behavior for early signs of illness

### Feeding Schedule (Example)

| Age        | Feed Type | Protein |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| 0–8 weeks  | Starter   | 18–20%  |
| 8–16 weeks | Grower    | 16–18%  |
| 16+ weeks  | Layer     | 16%     |

### Tips and Tricks

- Keep feed dry and in sealed containers
- Use nipple waterers to reduce contamination
- Provide shade and dust-bath areas in the run

#### Handy Shell Script (example)

```bash
# Record today’s egg count
DATE=$(date +%F)
COUNT=7
echo "$DATE,$COUNT" >> egg_log.csv
```

#### Inline Code and Notes

Run `npm run dev` to start your documentation site and preview updates.
