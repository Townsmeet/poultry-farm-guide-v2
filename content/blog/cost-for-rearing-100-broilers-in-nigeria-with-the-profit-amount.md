## **How much does it cost to rear 100 broilers in Nigeria?**
Let's assume you have a structure already in place manpower, and labor will be done by you and your family.
These are the key expenses:
These **estimates** are all based on current prices
1\. 100-day-old chick (DOC) is sold at  ₦850, thus, 100 chicks will be sold at ₦85,000
2.  Plywood, tarpaulin, or Nylons for making brooder = ₦7000
3\. 1 bag of charcoal for heating the brooder = ₦8500
4\. 1 charcoal burner (Jiko) = ₦6,000

### 5. **How many bag feeds do I need to rear 100 broilers in 8 weeks?**
The table below shows male and female broilers' age, expected body weight, and cumulative feed intake.
We shall use it to estimate the quantity of feed 100 broiler chicks will consume at various weeks.
![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/IMG_20201024_214553.jpg)
Some farmers give their broiler a grower, but I don’t give my grower a mash. I only provide starter mash for 4 weeks, then finisher till marketable size at 6 to 8 weeks.
#### **a.**  **How many bags of starter mash will 100 broilers consume in four (4) weeks?**
So, from the table;
At 4 weeks a bird will consume between 2020g for males and 1825g for females.
Average = (2020 + 1825)g/2 =1922.5g
Therefore,
 1 chick feed
1922.5g of starter mash at 4 weeks
100 chicks feed 192250g of starter mash at 4 weeks
1000g = 1kg
Therefore 192250g =192.25kg
25kg =I bag=₦21,750
192.25kg =7.69 bags  **\=₦ 167,257
**
So, for the first 4 weeks, 100 broilers will consume 7.69 bags of starter mash worth **₦167,257**
#### **b. How many bags of finisher mash will 100 broilers consume in four (5 to 8 weeks) weeks?- assuming I am targeting 8 weeks**
From the table above, the cumulative feed for male and female broilers at week 8 is 7400g and 6800 respectively
Average = (7400 + 6800)g/2= 7100g
Cumulative feed intake from 5 to 8 weeks = cumulative feed intake at 8 weeks minus (-) cumulative feed intake at 4 weeks (7100 – 1922.5)g = 5177.5g
1 broiler chicken will feed 5177.5g from 5 to 8 weeks
100 broiler chickens will feed 517750g from 5 to 8 weeks
1000g = 1kg
517750g=517.75kg
25kg = 1 bag = **₦ 22,600**
517.75kg=20.71 bags=**₦460,046**
100 broiler chickens will consume 20.71 bags of finisher at **₦460,046**
Total cost for feed =( 167,257+ 460.046) ₦ = **₦627,303**

### **6.  Cost of [Vaccine](/blog/Poultry-vaccination-and-schedule%20for%20layers%20and%20Broilers/) for rearing 100 broilers in Nigeria**
-   100 doses of NCD (Lasota) on day 1, day 14, and day 28 (**₦1200x 3) ₦3600.** 100 doses of Gumboro= **₦1500**
**Vaccine in totality =** (3600+ 1500)₦ **= ₦5100**
### **![](https://farm-assets.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/images+(35).jpg)**
###### Intramuscular vaccination
### **7\. Vitamins and Antibiotics**
-   2 Packs of Vitamin (300g)@ 5400
-   2 Packs of antibiotics (300g)@8000
Total Vitamin and Antibiotics =(5400+8000) ₦ =  **₦13,400**

### 8  **Feeders and Drinkers**
-   4 tube feeders with 28 holes each @₦10,000
-   8 big woody feeders@₦20,000
-   6  small drinkers @ = ₦**5700**
-   6 big drinker @ = ₦18,700
Total for drinkers (5700 + 18,700)=₦24,400
-   10 big bags of Wood shavings  @= ₦10,000
## **The total cost of rearing 100 broilers in Nigeria is;**
Total Cost = (DOT + Plywood + Charcoal + Charcoal burner + Starter feed + Finisher feed + Vaccine + Vitamin and Antibiotics + Feeder , Drinker , and Wood shavings)
#### Total Cost = **(** 85,000\+ 7000 + 8500 + 6,000 + 167,000 + 627,303 +5100 +5400+ 8000 + 30,000+ 24400+5000)₦ = **₦978,703**
Kindly note that these are the major costs. Most are capital costs, meaning they shall not be incurred in subsequent production.
In total, you need at least **₦978, 703**  to rear 100 broiler chicks for 8 weeks.
And cost of feed is over 70%, which is one the biggest challenges in poultry farming in recent time
You do not need all this cash at a go to start a broiler farm, maybe you even need a quarter to start. Start now!

## **Profit Amount From Rearing 100 Broilers in Nigeria**
###  **So How much profit do I expect from 100 broiler chickens?**
To get the profit amount you have to get the cost of rearing one bird. To get this you divide the total cost by the total number of chicks =₦ 978,703/100 =₦9,787
 Therefore, the cost of rearing one bird is ₦9,787
Next, is to decide how much profit you should add to your cost per bird. To do this, without getting stranded in the course of selling your bird, you have to know the market prices of various sizes/weights of broiler chickens in the market.
At the time of writing this, the market price (in my area) is between ₦10,000 to ₦15,000. Thus, the average is **₦12,500**
So let's assume you will be selling one bird @ ₦12,500.

> ###### Last december 2023,  I sold The Above chicken sizes between 9000 to 13,000
Remember not all birds will survive to week 8. Therefore, cumulative mortality at week 8 is assumed to be 4% when all factors are held optimum. Thus cumulative mortality shall be
100 x4/100 = 4
Total surviving birds =100-4 = 96
Total sales= ₦12500 x96 = **₦1,200,000**
### **PROFIT = TOTAL SALES - TOTAL COST**
 (1,200,000 – 978,703)₦ =**₦ 221,297**
### **The profit amount from rearing 100 broilers in Nigeria is ₦ 221,297
**
**Percentage profit = 221297/978703 x100 = 22.61%. Quite impressive. With good management and strategies, profit margin can be increased**
**Selling at 6 weeks can increase your profit by %10 definitely, and you will spend less on feeding which is the main cost of production.**
I wish you profitable sales in your poultry farming business.

**How many bags of feed will 100 broilers consume?**
From our calculation above, 100 broilers will consume 8 bags approximately for the first 4 weeks, and consume 20 bags approximately from week 5 to week 8. Giving us a total of 28 bags

**How long does it take a broiler to mature?**
The maturity of broilers depends on so many factors including breed, gender, management, etc. But if everything is kept at optimum, the broiler will get mature from 6 weeks upwards. But the market size is between 6 to 8 weeks. Keeping the broiler beyond 8 weeks will incur expenses.

Live weight broiler reared for 7 or 8 weeks is sold for ₦ 4500 to ₦ 7000 depending on the size/weight or gender. Males is costlier than females in general. If you are selling frozen chicken in the kilo, a kilo is sold for 2,500 nairas (sometimes five dollars).
