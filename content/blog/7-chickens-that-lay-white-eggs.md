There are various variations of Leghorn Chicken. There is blue, white, gold but the most common Leghorn Chicken is the white Leghorn Chicken.
It's quite funny how a lot of people believe the white Leghorn Chicken is the only type of Leghorn Chicken that produces white chickens. The truth is, all the types of Leghorn Chicken produce white Eggs. But the only type readily available and readily used to get white eggs is the white Leghorn Chicken.

#### **Leghorn Eggs**

The Leghorn Chicken lays large white eggs that are delicious to consume. The eggs are large and white. The good thing about Leghorn Chicken is the fact that they produce over 200 to 280 white eggs per year. That means rearing Leghorn Chicken spells yearly profit for you.

#### **Leghorn Personality**

The only downside to this chicken breed is the low incubating capacity of the chicken. You need an [external incubator](https://amzn.to/3z7wRYH) for the eggs you want to hatch and breed.
One predominant characteristic of the leghorn chicken is its activeness. Unlike other breeds of chicken, they are always curious and want to wander off. You need to rear these breeds in a Poultry that is fenced.

The third best white egg-producing chicken is Ancona. It's another best Italian foreign breed from the city of Ancona in Italy.

#### **Ancona Eggs**

Ancona eggs are actually small in size but slightly bigger than Polish eggs but in size and quantity. You can have over 200- 220 eggs yearly from ancona Chicken.

Ancona Chicken, just like other Italian chicken breeds, is always active and curious. They are skittish and always ready to fly.
If you don't want to lose your Ancona Chicken then you must have a large fence, one which the Ancona Chicken, no matter how hard they fly, won't be able to reach the top.
It will also be a plus to you if you know how to disable the wings without Harming the Ancona Chicken.
One thing you should remember is your purpose in rearing this type of Italian chicken. If it's solely for the white eggs then you can disable the wings. But if you'll still sell the Ancona Chicken, then I'll suggest you get a high fence instead of disabling its wings.
